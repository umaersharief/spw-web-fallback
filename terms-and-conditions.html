            <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Individuals who book and pay for services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Subscription Plans and Payment</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Subscription Tiers</h3>
        <p>SPW offers three subscription tiers for service providers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Plan:</strong> £9.99/month - Essential business management features</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Plan:</strong> £19.99/month - Advanced reporting and analytics (Most Popular)</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Plan:</strong> £39.99/month - Full financial reports and premium features</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>All subscription fees are charged monthly in advance. Payments are non-refundable except as required by law.
            You may cancel your subscription at any time, but you will continue to have access until the end of your
            current billing period.</p>

        <h3>4.3 E-Wallet System</h3>
        <p>SPW provides an e-wallet system where users can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store funds for subscription payments</li>
            <li>Receive referral rewards and bonuses</li>
            <li>Transfer funds to their bank account</li>
            <li>Use funds to pay for monthly subscriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>4.4 E-Wallet Usage for Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>Service providers can choose to use their e-wallet balance to pay for their monthly subscription fees.
                The platform provides a dedicated interface for selecting the amount to be deducted from the e-wallet
                for subscription payments.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Referral System and Rewards</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Referral Program</h3>
        <p>SPW operates a referral system where service providers can earn rewards by referring new users to the
            platform.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Referral Rewards</h3>
        <p>When a referred service provider successfully subscribes and maintains their subscription, the referring
            service provider earns a £1 bonus reward.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <h3>5.3 Important Referral Payment Terms</h3>
            <p><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Referral rewards are only paid when the referred service provider maintains an
                active, paid subscription. If a referred service provider fails to pay for their subscription, the £1
                bonus reward will NOT be paid to the referring service provider.</p>

            <p>In cases where a referred service provider does not pay their subscription fees, the £1 bonus amount
                automatically reverts to S.P.W. Ltd's account, regardless of the referral relationship.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>5.4 Referral Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Example using Barbers as Service Providers:</strong></p>

                <li>Barber A sends a referral code to Barber B</li>
                <li>Barber B subscribes and pays £15 monthly subscription</li>
                <li>Barber A pays £15 for their monthly subscription</li>
                <li>Barber A receives £1 reward for the successful referral</li>
                <li>If Barber B stops paying their subscription, Barber A will NOT receive the £1 reward, and the amount
                    goes to S.P.W. Ltd</li>
            </ul>
